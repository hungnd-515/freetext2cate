#Story
When our user signup an account, they will be asked about their categories. 
Base on our list of categories, they will choose one/some fit to their business. 
But somehow they couldn't find their categories, they can input some freetext.

=> So how our company handle those text?

We need a model to map those texts into our categories

So I try to find solution with NLP

This version I only use word2vec to try my model
